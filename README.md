[Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) in [syntran](https://adventofcode.com/)

## What is syntran?

Syntran is my interpretted, array-oriented language.  The interpreter is written in this repo:  https://github.com/JeffIrwin/syntran

See the [README](https://github.com/JeffIrwin/syntran) in the syntran repo for instructions on how to build the interpretter.  You will need a Fortran compiler 

## Running advent of code

To run a solution for AOC, change to the directory for that day's solution and run the syntran interpretter.  For example:

```
cd 2023/01
syntran ./main.syntran
```

As of 2023-12-01, you will need at least syntran version 0.0.27 to run the code here
